In our proposed solution we aim at a combination of Neuroscience principles, Abstract thinking and Prototyping, towards a solution aiming at bringing the efficiency and robustness of biological intelligence to technical systems that solve real-world problems. We start from the proposed Neuroscientific Research Challenges and propose a novel model and system capable of learning invariant representation.

Using cortical maps as neural substrate for distributed representations of sensory streams, our system is able to learn its connectivity (i.e., structure) from the long-term evolution of sensory observations. This process mimics a typical development process where self-construction (connectivity learning), self-organization, and correlation extraction ensure a refined and stable representation and processing substrate, as also shown in [10]. Following these principles, we propose a model based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) [11] and Hebbian Learning (HL) [12] as main ingredients for extracting underlying correlations in sensory data, the basis for subsequently extracting invariant representations.
